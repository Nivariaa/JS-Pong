Main Goal:
The goal of each player is to prevent the ball from touching their side of the field
by bouncing it away using their paddles. If they failed to do so, their opponent scores
a point.

Serving:
Before serving, the ball moves up and down across the paddle of the player who is serving.
The ball will move to the direction based on its position from the server's paddle 
before it is served away.

Ball Mechanics:
The game picks a random ball speed after being served, and the ball also moves a little
faster every time it hits a paddle. If the ball hits the nearest edge of a paddle, it 
will bounce back instead of bouncing away.

Laser Blast:
Every time the ball hits a paddle, the player who owns the paddle will gain 1 energy. If
the ball bounced from the paddle's nearest edge, the player will instead gain 2 energy.
At 10 energy, a player can press its Laser Blast button to shoot a Laser Beam. If the
Laser Beam hits the opponent's paddle, the player will score a point.
